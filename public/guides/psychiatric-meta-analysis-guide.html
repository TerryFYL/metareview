          "text": "The standard approach is to use Standardized Mean Difference (SMD), which divides the mean difference by the pooled standard deviation, making results comparable across scales. Important considerations: never mix clinician-rated (HAMD, MADRS) and self-rated (PHQ-9, BDI-II) scales without sensitivity analysis, as they measure different constructs. Also consider that HAMD-17 and HAMD-21 have different score ranges and should not be treated as interchangeable in MD analyses."

          "text": "Placebo response rates in antidepressant trials typically range from 30-50%, which compresses the drug-placebo difference and makes true treatment effects harder to detect. Placebo response has also increased over time (a secular trend documented since the 1980s), meaning older trials tend to show larger drug-placebo differences than newer ones. This creates heterogeneity when pooling studies across decades. Additionally, high placebo response is a leading cause of failed trials, introducing selection bias if only successful trials are published."

          "text": "Network meta-analysis (NMA) simultaneously compares multiple treatments even when they have not been directly compared in head-to-head trials. This is critical in psychiatry because most antidepressant and antipsychotic trials compare a single drug to placebo, making direct comparisons between active drugs rare. The landmark Cipriani et al. 2018 Lancet NMA compared 21 antidepressants using 522 trials, providing the most comprehensive efficacy and acceptability ranking. NMA relies on the consistency assumption: indirect comparisons (A vs B via A vs C and B vs C) must agree with available direct comparisons."

Negative trials were either not published or published in a way that conveyed a positive outcome. This inflates pooled effect sizes by approximately 32%. Always search ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished trials, use funnel plots and Egger's test, and apply Trim-and-Fill correction."

LOCF assumes that a patient's last observed score remains unchanged, which biases results (usually toward the drug in depression trials, because early dropouts may have been improving). MMRM uses all available data without imputation and is now the FDA-preferred approach. If some studies only report LOCF, conduct a sensitivity analysis comparing results with and without LOCF-only studies."

          "text": "Diagnostic criteria affect who is included in trials. For example, DSM-5 removed the bereavement exclusion for major depressive disorder, potentially broadening the study population. DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia differ in symptom duration requirements. ICD-10 and ICD-11 definitions may also differ from DSM. These differences create clinical heterogeneity. Record which diagnostic system each study used, and consider subgroup analysis by diagnostic criteria if sufficient studies exist. In practice, DSM-IV and DSM-5 depression criteria are similar enough to pool, but document this decision."

          "text": "There is no strict minimum, but the network must be connected (every treatment linked to at least one other treatment through direct or indirect evidence). For a meaningful NMA, you typically need at least 2-3 studies per comparison to assess consistency. The Cipriani 2018 antidepressant NMA included 522 trials across 21 drugs. Smaller NMAs with 20-50 trials comparing 5-8 treatments are common and publishable. Ensure you assess the transitivity assumption (study characteristics are similar across comparisons) and run node-splitting to check consistency between direct and indirect evidence."

    <h2>1. Why Meta-Analysis Is Critical in Psychiatry</h2>
    <p>Psychiatric disorders affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide, yet individual trials frequently produce conflicting results. Effect sizes are typically small to moderate (SMD 0.2&ndash;0.5 for antidepressants), placebo response rates are high, and dozens of competing treatments exist without head-to-head comparisons. Meta-analysis addresses these challenges by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Increasing statistical power</strong> &mdash; Small drug-placebo differences become detectable only when pooling thousands of patients across trials.</li>
      <li><strong>Resolving the "do antidepressants work?" debate</strong> &mdash; Kirsch et al. (2008) and Cipriani et al. (2018, Lancet) reached different conclusions partly due to methodological choices in their meta-analyses. Understanding these choices is essential.</li>
      <li><strong>Comparing treatments that were never directly compared</strong> &mdash; Network meta-analysis (NMA) allows ranking of 21 antidepressants or 15 antipsychotics despite most trials only comparing one drug to placebo.</li>
      <li><strong>Quantifying publication bias</strong> &mdash; Turner et al. (2008, NEJM) showed that 94% of published antidepressant trials were positive, while FDA records revealed only 51% were truly positive. Meta-analysis with bias correction provides a more honest estimate.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="tip"><strong>Key psychiatric meta-analyses that shaped clinical practice:</strong> Cipriani 2018 (21 antidepressants NMA, Lancet), Leucht 2013 (antipsychotic efficacy, Lancet), Turner 2008 (publication bias, NEJM), Cuijpers 2019 (psychotherapy vs pharmacotherapy).</div>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="pico">
    <h2>2. Defining Your Psychiatric Research Question (PICO)</h2>
    <p>A precise PICO framework prevents scope creep and unmanageable heterogeneity. Psychiatric populations are highly variable, so specificity at this stage saves enormous effort later.</p>

    <h2>3. Choosing the Right Effect Size</h2>
    <p>This is the most critical decision in psychiatric meta-analysis. Because studies use different rating scales for the same construct, Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) is the default choice &mdash; unlike most other medical fields where Mean Difference (MD) is common.</p>

    <h2>4. Handling Rating Scale Differences</h2>
    <p>Rating scale heterogeneity is the defining challenge of psychiatric meta-analysis. Unlike blood pressure or tumor size, psychiatric symptoms are measured through subjective scales with different items, scoring ranges, and rater perspectives.</p>

    <h3>Major Depression Scales</h3>
    <table class="data-table">
      <tr><th>Scale</th><th>Type</th><th>Items</th><th>Score Range</th><th>Response Threshold</th><th>Remission Threshold</th></tr>
      <tr><td>HAMD-17</td><td>Clinician-rated</td><td>17</td><td>0&ndash;52</td><td>&ge;50% reduction</td><td>&le;7</td></tr>
      <tr><td>HAMD-21</td><td>Clinician-rated</td><td>21</td><td>0&ndash;66</td><td>&ge;50% reduction</td><td>&le;7 (first 17 items)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>MADRS</td><td>Clinician-rated</td><td>10</td><td>0&ndash;60</td><td>&ge;50% reduction</td><td>&le;10</td></tr>
      <tr><td>PHQ-9</td><td>Self-rated</td><td>9</td><td>0&ndash;27</td><td>&ge;50% reduction</td><td>&le;4</td></tr>
      <tr><td>BDI-II</td><td>Self-rated</td><td>21</td><td>0&ndash;63</td><td>&ge;50% reduction</td><td>&le;12</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Other Key Psychiatric Scales</h3>
    <table class="data-table">
      <tr><th>Disorder</th><th>Scale</th><th>Type</th><th>Score Range</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Schizophrenia</td><td>PANSS</td><td>Clinician-rated</td><td>30&ndash;210</td></tr>

      <tr><td>OCD</td><td>Y-BOCS</td><td>Clinician-rated</td><td>0&ndash;40</td></tr>
    </table>

    <div class="warn"><strong>Critical rule: Do not mix clinician-rated and self-rated scales without sensitivity analysis.</strong> Clinician-rated scales (HAMD, MADRS) tend to show larger drug-placebo differences than self-rated scales (PHQ-9, BDI-II). If you pool both types, conduct a subgroup analysis by rater type and report results separately.</div>

    <h3>Practical Recommendations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use SMD</strong> whenever studies use more than one scale &mdash; this is nearly always the case in psychiatry</li>
      <li><strong>Prefer change scores</strong> over endpoint scores when available, as they reduce between-subject variability</li>
      <li><strong>Never convert HAMD-17 to HAMD-21</strong> by adding estimated points for the extra 4 items &mdash; this introduces noise</li>
      <li><strong>Run sensitivity analysis</strong> restricting to the most commonly used scale (usually HAMD-17) to check robustness</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="placebo">
    <h2>5. The Placebo Effect Problem</h2>
    <p>No other medical field faces the placebo challenge quite like psychiatry. The placebo response in antidepressant trials typically ranges from 30% to 50%, dwarfing the drug-specific effect and creating unique analytical difficulties.</p>

    <h3>Key Facts About the Psychiatric Placebo Response</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> Placebo arms in MDD trials show a mean improvement of ~10 points on HAMD-17. Drug arms improve ~13 points. The drug-specific effect is only ~3 points.</li>
      <li><strong>Temporal trend:</strong> Placebo response has increased over decades. Trials from the 1980s showed lower placebo response than trials from the 2010s, creating a confound when pooling across eras.</li>
      <li><strong>Failed trials:</strong> Approximately 50% of antidepressant trials "fail" (do not separate drug from placebo), not because drugs are ineffective but because placebo response was unusually high in that trial.</li>
      <li><strong>Site variability:</strong> Multi-site trials show enormous variability in placebo response across sites (20%&ndash;70%), often driven by rater training differences and patient selection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How the Placebo Effect Impacts Your Meta-Analysis</h3>
    <table class="data-table">
      <tr><th>Impact</th><th>Mechanism</th><th>Mitigation Strategy</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Compressed effect sizes</td><td>High placebo response leaves little room for drug superiority</td><td>Report both absolute and relative effect sizes; use NNT for clinical interpretation</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Heterogeneity inflation</td><td>Variable placebo response across trials increases I&sup2;</td><td>Meta-regression with placebo response rate as covariate</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Publication year confound</td><td>Newer trials have higher placebo rates and smaller effects</td><td>Subgroup by decade or meta-regression on publication year</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Selection bias</td><td>Failed trials less likely to be published</td><td>Include FDA review data and ClinicalTrials.gov results</td></tr>
    </table>

    <div class="tip"><strong>Severity matters:</strong> Kirsch et al. (2008) argued that antidepressant effects were clinically significant only in severely depressed patients (baseline HAMD &ge;28). Fournier et al. (2010) confirmed a severity-response gradient. Consider subgroup analysis by baseline severity.</div>

    <h2>6. Data Extraction Checklist for Psychiatric Studies</h2>
    <p>Psychiatric trials have unique reporting patterns. Use this checklist to ensure complete, consistent extraction.</p>

    <h3>Study Characteristics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>First author, publication year, journal, NCT registration number</li>
      <li>Study design (RCT, crossover, open-label), phase, sponsor (industry vs academic)</li>
      <li>Region/country, number of sites</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Patient Population</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Diagnosis and diagnostic criteria (DSM-IV, DSM-5, ICD-10, ICD-11)</li>
      <li>Baseline severity (mean HAMD or MADRS score, severity category)</li>
      <li>Episode characteristics (first episode vs recurrent, duration of current episode)</li>
      <li>Comorbidities (anxiety, substance use, personality disorder)</li>
      <li>Sample size per arm (ITT and completer populations)</li>
      <li>Age, sex, treatment history (treatment-naive vs treatment-resistant)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Intervention Details</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Drug name, dose (fixed vs flexible dosing), titration schedule</li>
      <li>For psychotherapy: modality (CBT, IPT, DBT), number and frequency of sessions, therapist qualifications</li>
      <li>Placebo type (pill placebo, psychological placebo, waitlist)</li>
      <li>Trial duration (acute phase: typically 6&ndash;12 weeks for MDD)</li>
      <li>Concomitant medications allowed (especially benzodiazepines, sleep aids)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outcomes Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Primary scale and version (HAMD-17 vs HAMD-21 vs MADRS)</li>
      <li>Mean and SD of change scores (or endpoint scores) per arm</li>
      <li>Response and remission rates (events/total per arm)</li>
      <li>Dropout rates (all-cause and AE-related, per arm)</li>
      <li>Analysis method: <strong>LOCF vs MMRM vs observed cases</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warn"><strong>LOCF vs MMRM matters enormously.</strong> LOCF (Last Observation Carried Forward) biases results in unpredictable directions. MMRM (Mixed-Model Repeated Measures) is preferred by the FDA and EMA since ~2008. Record which method each study used and plan a sensitivity analysis.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="heterogeneity">
    <h2>7. Handling Heterogeneity in Psychiatric Trials</h2>
    <p>Psychiatric meta-analyses almost always show moderate to high heterogeneity (I&sup2; 40%&ndash;80%). Understanding and accounting for the sources is essential for credible results.</p>

    <h3>Sources of Heterogeneity Specific to Psychiatry</h3>
    <table class="data-table">
      <tr><th>Source</th><th>Examples</th><th>Impact on Effect Size</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Diagnostic criteria</td><td>DSM-IV vs DSM-5 vs ICD-10/11</td><td>Different patient populations enrolled</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Baseline severity</td><td>Mild (HAMD 8&ndash;13) vs moderate (14&ndash;18) vs severe (19&ndash;22) vs very severe (&ge;23)</td><td>Larger drug-placebo difference in severe patients</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Rating scale</td><td>HAMD-17 vs MADRS vs PHQ-9</td><td>Different sensitivity to change; managed by SMD but adds noise</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Drug dose</td><td>Sub-therapeutic vs therapeutic vs supra-therapeutic</td><td>Dose-response relationship varies by drug</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Trial duration</td><td>4 weeks vs 8 weeks vs 12 weeks</td><td>Longer trials: larger placebo response, potentially larger drug effect</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Publication year</td><td>1990s vs 2000s vs 2010s vs 2020s</td><td>Secular increase in placebo response; changes in trial methodology</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Comorbidity</td><td>MDD alone vs MDD + anxiety vs MDD + substance use</td><td>Comorbid patients may respond differently</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Sponsor type</td><td>Industry vs academic vs government</td><td>Industry trials may have allegiance effects</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Recommended Strategies</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Always use random-effects models</strong> &mdash; Fixed-effect is almost never appropriate in psychiatry given the clinical diversity</li>
      <li><strong>Pre-specify subgroup analyses</strong> by drug class, severity, scale type, and trial duration</li>
      <li><strong>Meta-regression</strong> on baseline severity, publication year, and placebo response rate (if &ge;10 studies)</li>
      <li><strong>Sensitivity analysis</strong> &mdash; Leave-one-out; restrict to HAMD-17 only; exclude studies with high risk of bias; MMRM-only vs all studies</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="tip"><strong>In MetaReview:</strong> Heterogeneity statistics (I&sup2;, Q, &tau;&sup2;) are automatically calculated. Use the subgroup column and meta-regression feature to explore sources of heterogeneity.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="nma">
    <h2>8. Subgroup and Network Meta-Analysis</h2>

    <h3>Subgroup Analysis</h3>
    <p>Pre-specified subgroup analyses are essential for interpreting psychiatric meta-analyses. Common subgroup variables include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Drug class:</strong> SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, paroxetine, citalopram) vs SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine) vs atypicals (mirtazapine, bupropion, vortioxetine)</li>
      <li><strong>Severity:</strong> Mild vs moderate vs severe depression (based on baseline HAMD or MADRS)</li>
      <li><strong>Age group:</strong> Adolescents vs adults vs elderly (antidepressant efficacy and safety differ by age)</li>
      <li><strong>Treatment modality:</strong> Pharmacotherapy vs psychotherapy vs combination</li>
      <li><strong>Scale type:</strong> Clinician-rated vs self-rated instruments</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Network Meta-Analysis (NMA)</h3>
    <p>NMA is arguably the most impactful analytical method in psychiatric research. Because head-to-head trials between active drugs are rare, NMA uses indirect comparisons through a common comparator (usually placebo) to rank multiple treatments simultaneously.</p>

    <h3>The Cipriani 2018 Landmark Study</h3>
    <p>Cipriani et al. (Lancet, 2018) conducted the largest NMA of antidepressants ever performed: 522 double-blind RCTs, 116,477 patients, 21 antidepressants. Key findings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>All 21 antidepressants</strong> were more effective than placebo for acute MDD treatment</li>
      <li><strong>Most effective:</strong> amitriptyline, mirtazapine, venlafaxine, escitalopram</li>
      <li><strong>Best tolerated (lowest dropout):</strong> agomelatine, fluoxetine, escitalopram, citalopram</li>
      <li><strong>Overall best balance of efficacy and acceptability:</strong> escitalopram, sertraline, mirtazapine, venlafaxine</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>NMA Requirements and Assumptions</h3>
    <table class="data-table">
      <tr><th>Requirement</th><th>Description</th><th>How to Check</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Connected network</td><td>Every treatment must link to at least one other via direct or indirect evidence</td><td>Draw the network graph; check for disconnected nodes</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Transitivity</td><td>Study characteristics must be similar across comparisons</td><td>Compare baseline severity, duration, year across different comparison sets</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Consistency</td><td>Direct and indirect estimates must agree</td><td>Node-splitting test; design-by-treatment interaction test</td></tr>
    </table>

    <div class="tip"><strong>Antipsychotic NMA:</strong> Leucht et al. (Lancet, 2013) performed a similar NMA for 15 antipsychotics in schizophrenia, comparing efficacy (PANSS/BPRS reduction), all-cause discontinuation, and specific side effects (weight gain, sedation, EPS). Clozapine was most effective; aripiprazole had the most favorable side-effect profile.</div>

    <h2>9. Step-by-Step: Psychiatry Meta-Analysis in MetaReview</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Select Effect Measure</h3>
    <p>Open MetaReview and choose the appropriate measure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SMD (Hedges' g)</strong> for continuous symptom scores across different scales (most common)</li>
      <li><strong>Mean Difference</strong> if all studies use the same scale version</li>
      <li><strong>Odds Ratio</strong> for response/remission rates</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 2: Enter Study Data</h3>
    <p>For SMD analysis: enter Study name, Year, Mean, SD, and N for both Treatment and Control arms.</p>
    <p>For OR analysis: enter Study name, Year, Events and Total for both arms.</p>
    <div class="tip"><strong>Batch entry:</strong> Organize your data in Excel or Google Sheets, then copy and paste directly into MetaReview. The tool auto-detects tabular data.</div>

    <h3>Step 3: Assign Subgroups</h3>
    <p>Use the Subgroup column to label studies by drug class (SSRI, SNRI, atypical), severity level, or scale type. This enables stratified forest plots with Q-between tests.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Run the Analysis</h3>
    <p>Click <strong>"Run Meta-Analysis"</strong>. Results appear within seconds:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Forest plot with individual and pooled SMD (or OR)</li>
      <li>Subgroup forest plot with Q-between significance test</li>
      <li>Funnel plot for publication bias assessment</li>
      <li>Heterogeneity statistics (I&sup2;, Q, &tau;&sup2;)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 5: Advanced Diagnostics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Egger's / Begg's test</strong> &mdash; Quantitative publication bias assessment (critical for psychiatric data)</li>
      <li><strong>Trim-and-Fill</strong> &mdash; Estimate impact of missing negative studies</li>
      <li><strong>Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis</strong> &mdash; Check whether any single trial drives the result</li>
      <li><strong>Meta-regression</strong> &mdash; Test baseline severity or publication year as moderators</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 6: Export Report</h3>
    <p>Generate an HTML or DOCX report with all figures, tables, auto-generated Methods paragraph (PRISMA 2020 format), and narrative interpretation including SMD-to-clinical-meaning conversion.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="pitfalls">
    <h2>10. Common Pitfalls in Psychiatric Meta-Analysis</h2>

    <h3>Pitfall 1: Ignoring Publication Bias</h3>
    <p>Turner et al. (2008, NEJM) demonstrated that publication bias inflates antidepressant effect sizes by approximately 32%. Relying only on published literature produces an overly optimistic estimate of drug efficacy.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Search ClinicalTrials.gov and FDA medical reviews for unpublished data. Use funnel plots, Egger's test, and Trim-and-Fill. Always report both corrected and uncorrected pooled estimates.</p>

    <h3>Pitfall 2: The Kirsch Debate &mdash; Clinical vs Statistical Significance</h3>
    <p>Kirsch et al. (2008) reported a pooled SMD of &minus;0.32 for SSRIs vs placebo, arguing this was below the NICE threshold of 0.50 for clinical significance. Others argued the 0.50 threshold was arbitrary and that even SMD = 0.30 translates to meaningful symptom relief for many patients.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Report SMD alongside clinically interpretable metrics: NNT (number needed to treat), HAMD-point equivalents (SMD &times; SD_placebo), and response/remission rate differences.</p>

    <h3>Pitfall 3: Mixing Scales Without Using SMD</h3>
    <p>Pooling raw mean differences from HAMD-17 (range 0&ndash;52) and MADRS (range 0&ndash;60) produces nonsensical results because a 3-point change means entirely different things on each scale.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always use SMD (Hedges' g) when combining data from different rating scales. This is not optional &mdash; it is a fundamental methodological requirement.</p>

    <h3>Pitfall 4: LOCF vs MMRM Confusion</h3>
    <p>Many older trials report only LOCF results. LOCF carries forward the last observed score for patients who drop out, which can bias results in either direction. MMRM uses all available data without imputation and is now the regulatory standard.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Prefer MMRM data when available. Record the analysis method for each study. Run a sensitivity analysis excluding LOCF-only studies.</p>

    <h3>Pitfall 5: Not Accounting for Active Placebo</h3>
    <p>Standard pill placebos may be "unblinded" because patients can tell they are not experiencing side effects. Studies using active placebos (substances that mimic side effects without therapeutic action) show smaller drug-placebo differences.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Record whether the trial used an active or inert placebo. Consider subgroup analysis or at minimum discuss as a limitation.</p>

    <h3>Pitfall 6: Allegiance Effects</h3>
    <p>The researcher's theoretical allegiance (favoring psychotherapy vs pharmacotherapy, or one drug over another) can influence trial outcomes through subtle methodological choices. Industry-sponsored trials tend to favor the sponsor's drug.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Record sponsor type and declared conflicts of interest. Run subgroup analysis by sponsor (industry vs academic vs government). Use GRADE to downgrade certainty if most evidence comes from a single sponsor.</p>
