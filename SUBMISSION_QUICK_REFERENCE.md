## Important Tips

### For SaaSHub (CRITICAL)
- **List competitor products** (RevMan, Covidence, Stata, R metafor)
  - This moves your submission to the front of the queue
  - Without competitors listed, your submission goes to bottom
- **Use domain email** (hello@metareview.com)
  - Domain-based emails get priority verification
  - Much faster approval (24-48 hours vs 3-7 days)

### For AlternativeTo (CRITICAL)
- Be prepared for strict review
- Provide detailed, compelling description
- Highlight advantages over RevMan/Covidence/Stata
- Don't try to game the system (upvote manipulation results in penalties)

### For DevHunt
- GitHub login is fastest
- $49 feature option gets immediate approval if visibility needed
- Free option is fine for reaching relevant developers

### AlternativeTo
- If rejected, reasons could be:
  - Product not substantial enough (unlikely for MetaReview)
